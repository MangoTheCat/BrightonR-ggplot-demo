# BrightonR-ggplot-demo
The code to go along with the "Building a ggplot" talk/live demo from BrightonR on the 20/08/2020

The talk will build up the plot in real time (wow!) but check out the .Rmd for a step-by-step run through! (I hope I've got time for this...) 

## Data

I've taken the data from tidy tuesday, specifically week 14 on beer!
