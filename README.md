# BrightonR-ggplot-demo
The code to go along with the "Building a ggplot" talk/live demo from BrightonR on the 20/08/2020

The talk will build up the plot in real time (wow!) but check out `Building-a-ggplot.md` for a step-by-step run through!
The code I put together during the talk is in the `live` directory.

## Data
I've taken the data from tidy tuesday, specifically week 14 on beer!
